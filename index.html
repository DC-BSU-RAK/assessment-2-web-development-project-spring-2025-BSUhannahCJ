    <!-- paragraph -->
    <p>Hello users and readers! My name is Hannah Judeh. I am a university student at BathSpa University RAK studying
      creative computing. For
      our module Web Dev, we were tasked to develope a website for our second summative assessment. Out of the five
      themes we were given, I
      picked health. TakeCare.com is my take on it! Hey, who knows..this little project could become a real website in
      the future with
      more features! Also, please note that any of the websites and YouTube videos linked and attached are not created
      by me nor do I
      take any credits for those. They are just resources and references! I also do not claim to be an expert
      on these topics. Anyways, <i>take care!</i>
    </p>
