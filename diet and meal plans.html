    <p>We humans use food and water to survive, but the way we eat and drink can affect us negatively and positively.
      Our bodies work similarly but we have our differences like the way we grow or tolerate pain. Either way, we know
      that foods such as
      junk food and highly processed food can harm us. Vice versa, healthy food aids in improving our health. The thing
      is, balance is key.
      Too much of
      something bad or something good has its consequences.
